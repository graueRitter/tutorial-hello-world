Initial learning tutorial walk through

Adding readme-edits branch changes.

First clone play. Try commit within KDevelop. Note: `git status` indicates README.md has not been added. May add file as part of KDevelop 'commit' command. git global config is to force singing with graue.Ritter key.
-- Note: need to provide username and password to access GitHub as gpg key only verifies who committed, not authenticates.
-- Cannot push within KDevelop, so bash with username and password (GitHub).
