Initial learning tutorial walk through

Adding readme-edits branch changes.

First clone play. Try commit within KDevelop. Note: `git status` indicates README.md has not been added. May add file as part of KDevelop 'commit' command. git global config is to force singing with graue.Ritter key.
-- Note: need to provide username and password to access GitHub as gpg key only verifies who committed, not authenticates.
-- Cannot push within KDevelop, so bash with username and password (GitHub).

Next test: New branch:
- created new branch "EndOfLine" and checked out.
-line feeds not visible in uploaded file.
 - changed to 'Windows/DOS' end of line in editor settings on KDevelop (?also Kate?).

 \n2018-02-24T08:27Z - just a new commit, to check `git log --graph`.\n
 
 Trivial change to test status checks, and self reviewing.
 
 2020-06-24: git update and commit via KDevelop 5.5.2.
